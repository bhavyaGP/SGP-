            <h1>Best time to visit</h1>
            <p>
                The best time to visit Varanasi is during the winter months, from October to March. This period offers a
                pleasant and comfortable climate, with temperatures ranging from around 15째C to 25째C (59째F to 77째F). The
                cooler weather is ideal for exploring the city's bustling ghats, historical temples, and vibrant markets
                without being overwhelmed by the heat. Additionally, this is when many of the city's festivals and
                events take place, such as Diwali and the Ganga Mahotsav, adding an extra layer of cultural immersion to
                your experience. Monsoon season (July to September) can also be a unique time to visit, as the city gets
                a fresh, lush look and the Ganges River swells. However, heavy rainfall can disrupt outdoor plans. On
                the other hand, the scorching heat of summer (April to June) can be challenging for exploring, so it's
                best to avoid this period unless you're comfortable with high temperatures.
