                <p>
                    The best time to visit Coorg is during the months of October to April when the weather is pleasant and ideal for sightseeing and outdoor activities. During this time, the region is adorned with lush greenery, and the coffee plantations are at their scenic best. The monsoon season from June to September brings heavy rainfall and may not be suitable for outdoor adventures, but it transforms Coorg into a lush paradise. However, if you are a fan of waterfalls, the monsoon season is perfect for witnessing them in their full glory. Whether you seek a serene retreat amidst nature's embrace or wish to explore the rich cultural heritage, Coorg offers a memorable experience throughout the year, but the cooler months are the most popular among tourists.
